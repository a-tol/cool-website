an assortment of stuff in my front-end experiments
borrowDescriptions: uses https://dnd5eapi.co/ to borrow the name and description of a spell given the name (takes in string as search parameter, takes first result)/n
weathercard: uses https://api.weather.gov/ to get a simple forecast for a set of lat/long for right now, the next evening/morning, the next day, the next evening/mornging after that
